## Sending form data:

- Web uses client/server architecture
- Client sends request to a server using HTTP protocol
- HTML forms allow the user to send information to a server through HTTP request

### The client side:

- **Action attribute**: adding this to the form determines where data gets sent. Its value is a relative or absolutle URL. When not specified, it defaults to the current page
- **Method attribute**: get/post
1. Get: used to ask the server to send back a given response
2. Post: the browser asks the server for a response that takes into account the data provided in the HTTP body

### The server side:

- Any method you use will send a string to the server that must be parsed
- Raw PHP: offers global objects to access data

## Security Issues:

- HTML forms are a common vector for server attacks
- The problem lies not with the form, but how the server handles the data
-All data must be sanitized when it comes through a server
1. Escape potential dangerous characters, such as sequences that look like executable code
2. Limit incoming data and only allow what is necessary
3. Sandbox uploaded files and store them in a different server accessed through a subdomain
