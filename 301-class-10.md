# The Call Stack

- The call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter to keep track of its place in the script
- When a function is called, the interpreter ads it to the callstack and starts carrying out the function
- Functions that are called by that function are added to the callstack (further up)
- when the current function finishes, it is removed (or 'popped') from the call stack and the interpreter resumes executing the code where it left off previously
- Stack overflow occurs when the call stack takes up more space than it is assigned to

## Understanding the Call Stack
- If only a singled fucntion can be called andd running at a time, code is said to be "synchronous"
- Asynchronous code occurs when functions may have callbacks, event loops, and task queues
- Javascript is usually written asynchronously

1. **LIFO**: Last in, first out. The most recent fucntion to be added to the stack is the first to be executed and popped off when the fucntion returns

2. **Stack frame**: this is temporary storage and memory location in the stack. When a fucntion is invoked, the fucntion and its parameters and variables are committed to temporary memory in the stack frame and cleared when the fucntion returns

## Javascript erros:

1. Uncaught reference error: usually occurs when variables are not defined within the context of the fucntion

2. Syntax: parsing, unexpected tokens, usually caused by misplaced brackets, commas, etc

3. Range: occurs when working with objects of length. Means that a number outside the range of a fucntion was passed to it
