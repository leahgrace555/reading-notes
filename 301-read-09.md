# Refactoring JavaScript for Readability

## Concepts of functional programming in JavaScript

- Functional programming is a style of building structure and elements that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions

Pure Functions:
- will return the same result if given the same arguments

Example: This function
````
let Pi = 3.14;

const calcArea = (radius) => radius * radius * Pi;

calcArea(10);
````
This function is impure because it is using a global object, Pi, in its calculation
Pi could easily be reassigned thus changing the value of this function

How do we make this pure?
````
let Pi = 3.14;

const calcArea = (radius, Pi) => radius * radius * Pi;

calcArea(10,Pi);
````
- because we pass Pi as an arguement, we eliminate the possibility of an external object altering the calculation

## What makes a function impure?
- Reading files
- Random numbers generation

## immutability

- When data is immutable, its state cannot change once it is created
- instead of changing immutable objects, create a new one with the new value

## Refferential transparancy
- Example: a square function
````
const square = (n) => n*n;
````

- This is a pure function and will always give the same output
- passing the function 2 will always return 4
- bc of that, we can replace the square fucntion of 2 with 4 (they are referrentially transparent

## Pure functions + Immutable data = refferential transparency!
