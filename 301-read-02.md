# Jquery, Events and the DOM

## jquery:
- A simple way to acheive a variety of popular javascript tasks quickly and consistently
- Select elements, perform tasks and handle events

### Why use jquery?
- uses simple selectors and less code than vanilla javascript

### Finding elements:
- syntax:
````
$('element goes here').method();
````
- uses CSS type selectors, can use ids, classes and general element names

### chaining
- Can use multiple jquery methods on the same selection of elements

### checking if a page is ready
- the $(document).ready(function() { }); checks if a page is loaded before perfonring a functions

### getting element content:
- .html and .text are used to update and retreive information from the content of elements
- .html gets the html content from inside the element
- .text gets the text content only

### inserting elements:
- .before() inserts an element before the selected element
- .after() inserts after the selected element
- .prepend() inserts inside the selected element at the begiging of current elements
- .append() inserts inside the selected element after the inside content, before the closing tag

### Events
- When handling events with jquery, the callback funtion is always passed the event object
- example:
````
$('li').on('click, function(event) {
//code goes here
});
````
