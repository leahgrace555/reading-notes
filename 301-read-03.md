# Templating and Flexbox:

## Mustache Templating:
- Mustache is a 'logicless' templating system
- No ifs, elses, or loops. Only tags
- Mustache is not a templating engine, must be installed and used with node
- To use, do npm install mustache and must 'require' in your js file

## Flexbox:

- To use flexbox in CSS, the flex property must be applied to a parent element of the containing elements you want to flex
````
.container {
    display: flex;
  }
  ````
