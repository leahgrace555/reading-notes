# Reading 14b: What Google Learned About Teams:

- Students are often put in study groups to introduce them to the idea of working in teams
- Employers are increasingly using teams in the workplace to increase efficiency

## What makes a good team?

**Group Norms**: Behavioral traditions that govern how a team functions when it gathers

- Understanding and influencing group norms is the key to successful teams
- Focus less on the accomplishments of the individual members and more on the overall group dynamic

## Case Study: what did they notice?

Two key behaviors of the more successful teams:

1. Members speak in roughly proportionate amounts (Equal distribution of conversational turn-taking)
2. Members have average social sensitivity, meaning they can tell how others are feeling from social cues, and also care about how team-mates are feeling

Emphasis on the sum of the parts being grater than individual accomplishments
