## EJS Partials:
- EJS partials are another way to help you resuse HTML across multiple site pages
## Demo: 
- In a directory called views, make another directory call partials
- In the partials directory, make a file calles navbar.ejs
- In the Navbar.ejs file, write the HTML for your navbar
- To use this partial in another EJS file:
````
<% -body %>
<% include('partials/navbar')%> 
````
-It's that easy!
