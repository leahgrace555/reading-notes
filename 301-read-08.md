# SQL

## Structured query language
- Relational Databases: a Collection of two-dimensional related tables

## Select using SQL
- To retrieve data from a database, use a SELECT statement in your query
-Syntax:
````
SELECT <column> FROM <table>
````
- SELECT * selects all

## Filtering Results:
- To filter results, use a WHERE statement
Example: 
````
SELECT <column> FROM <table> WHERE <conditional goes here>
````
- other conditionals include like, not like, =, in, not in

## Sorting Results:
- SELECT DISTINCT will blindly remove repeat columns from a query
- ORDER BY column will sort results alphabetically
- Can specify ASC or DESC for order
