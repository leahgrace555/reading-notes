This was a fun exersice. It helped me learn about the following CSS properties: 

- **Grid-column-start:** specififes which column line to start on. Can take integers and spans
- **Grid-column-end: ** specifies which column line to end on. Can take integers or span
- **Grid-row-start:** specififes which row line to start on. Can take integers and spans
- **Grid-row-end: ** specifies which row line to end on. Can take integers or span
- **Grid-cloumn:** shorthand for grid columm start and end. Takes two values (start and end) separated by a forward slash
- **Grid-cloumn:** shorthand for grid row start and end. Takes two values (start and end) separated by a forward slash
- **Grid-area:** shorthand for row-start, row-end, column-start, column-end.To use, specify the four values separated by forward slashes. (syntax: grid-area: row-start / column-start / row-end / column-end)
- **Grid-template-rows:** defines a grid track size. (values indicate size and spaces indicate lines)
- **Grid-template-columns**: (values indicate size and spaces indicate lines)
